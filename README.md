This project uses a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to predict future stock prices based on historical data. LSTM, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN), is particularly well-suited for time series forecasting tasks like stock market prediction due to its ability to capture long-term dependencies.

## About

The model is trained on historical stock data and can predict future closing prices. The project includes data preprocessing, normalization, sequence generation, model training, evaluation, and visualization of predictions. It's ideal for data science enthusiasts and finance researchers interested in time series forecasting.
